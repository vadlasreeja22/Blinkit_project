## üîß Project Workflow

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow: Step-by-Step
This project followed a standard business intelligence workflow to ensure a logical and comprehensive analysis.

### Requirement Gathering:

Defined the project's goal: to create a sales analysis dashboard for Blinkit.
Identified key stakeholders and their informational needs (e.g., sales managers, marketing team).
Determined the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be measured and visualized, such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and Customer Ratings.

### Data Acquisition:

Sourced the raw sales dataset, which includes information on items, outlets, sales figures, and customer ratings.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation (Using Power Query Editor):

 Inspected the dataset for errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.
 Addressed null values in columns like Item_Weight.
 Standardized categorical data (e.g., ensuring "Low Fat" and "LF" are consistent) for accurate filtering and analysis.
 Ensured all columns had the correct data type (e.g., numerical for sales and ratings, text for item names).

### Data Modeling:

Created relationships between different tables (if multiple were used) to allow for cross-filtering and integrated analysis.This step ensures that visuals on the dashboard can interact with each other seamlessly.

### DAX Calculations:

Wrote Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create new measures and columns.Calculated key metrics such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and other aggregates to be displayed on the KPI cards and charts.


### Insights :

The total sales are $1.20M, with an average sale of $141.

Supermarket Type1 and Tier 3 outlets generate the highest total sales. The top-selling items are fruits and vegetables, followed by snacks.

 The overall average customer rating is 3.9.

The historical data shows a peak in sales around 2018, indicating a need to investigate the factors behind the subsequent decline.

 Grocery Stores have the highest item visibility, suggesting effective merchandising or a broader product range.
